Each ball is generated different types of balls which contain different weight and bonus point, and each hole will give certain points to the user base on the hole value + bonus point, and every time the user scores points, the score will increase and show on the scoreboard.The main goal for this game is: the heavier ball is, player has to push longer to throw it farther, it is a little challenging to throw it to the hole, but also can get more bonus point. 

How to play:
To be able to throw the ball the user will press on the screen. This will define position from where they will shoot the ball. The force to push the ball will be defined by how long the user holds the finger on the screen. This power will have minimum and a maximum power level. As soon as the power bar reaches the maximum it will go back to minimum, and when it reaches minimum again it will
go back to maximum.

Result:
As soon as the timer has completed you will see a popup telling the user the amount of points they have achieved and the position they obtained in the leaderboard. If you break the record, you can go to leaderboard page to check it out. Otherwise, you will have to try again to reach the max.
